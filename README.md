## Introduction

On the occasion of the course "Machine Learning" of the Computer Engineering course of the Andr√©s Bello University, we have been asked to propose a methodology to perform Machine Learning models in supervised learning to explain a particular problem. The problem to be addressed is to predict, from a dataset provided by the professor, whether a bank transaction will be fraudulent or not. The dataset contains the details of the transaction and of the card owner, so from these it must be predicted whether in the future a given transaction will correspond to fraud or not. This report details the characteristics of the dataset, some proposals of Machine Learning models to be used and the metrics that will be relevant to evaluate the best model. Then, the details of the different models evaluated are specified, the best model is selected and an explanation is made using the SHAP method. Finally, the respective conclusions are drawn.
